        <p><strong>App name(s):</strong> CurveKeeper Runes, CurveKeeper MTG (together, the "App")</p>
        <p><strong>Developer / Publisher (Data Controller):</strong> ARTEAH d.o.o.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:curvekeeper@arteah.hr">curvekeeper@arteah.hr</a></p>

        <h2>1) Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information when you scan trading cards, build decks, manage collections,
            and track in-person games. The App is designed to work primarily on-device and does not require an account.
            The App displays ads using Google AdMob, which may collect certain information automatically to serve and measure ads.
        </p>

        <h2>2) Information You Provide in the App (Stored on Your Device)</h2>
        <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device to provide core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deck data (deck lists, card quantities, notes/tags you enter)</li>
            <li>Collection data (cards you own, wishlists, custom groupings)</li>
            <li>In-person game data (match results, scores, timers/counters, notes)</li>
            <li>Settings (preferences, UI options)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>No accounts:</strong> The App does not require users to create accounts of any kind.</p>
        <p><strong>No developer servers:</strong> We do not operate backend servers for storing your decks/collections/game logs. Your content remains on your device unless you choose to share it (see Sections 4 and 5).</p>

        <h2>3) Permissions (Camera and Files)</h2>
        <p><strong>Camera:</strong> The App uses your device camera to scan cards. Scanning is performed on-device.</p>
        <p><strong>Files/Storage (optional):</strong> The App may create files on your device when you export a collection or create a backup.</p>

        <h2>4) Exports, Backups, and Sharing (You Control)</h2>
        <p>
            The App allows you to export a collection and/or create a full backup of your on-device data.
            These exports/backups are saved as files on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to share an export/backup (for example via email, messaging, AirDrop, cloud drive, etc.),
            the file is shared using your device’s standard sharing features and only with recipients and/or services you select.
            We do not receive a copy of exported/shared files.
        </p>

        <h2>5) Bad Scan Reports (Optional, User-Initiated Email)</h2>
        <p>
            If you report a bad scan, the App creates a <strong>.zip</strong> file on your device containing diagnostic information needed to improve scanning.
            The App then opens your email client with a draft message and the .zip attached. <strong>You choose whether to send it.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this report is sent by email, we will receive the contents of the attached file and standard email metadata (such as your email address, subject, and message).
            We use this information primarily to investigate and fix scanning issues. We may contact you if we need more details or may inform you when the issue is resolved.
        </p>

        <h2>6) Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
        <p>
            The App displays advertisements. You may have the option to temporarily disable ads by choosing to watch a rewarded ad
            (where available).
        </p>
        <p>
        If you choose to watch a rewarded ad, the App may grant a temporary benefit (such as a limited-time reduction of ads).
        This benefit is optional, and you can continue using the App without watching rewarded ads.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK) to display advertisements.
            The Google Mobile Ads SDK may automatically collect and share certain information to provide advertising, measurement, analytics, and fraud prevention.
        </p>
        <p>Examples of information that may be collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address (may be used to estimate general location)</li>
            <li>Device/account identifiers (for example, advertising identifiers)</li>
            <li>App interaction data (e.g., ad impressions, taps / ad interactions)</li>
            <li>Diagnostic information (e.g., performance/crash-related signals)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Personalized Ads and Choices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> If we use data for “tracking” as defined by Apple for ad personalization across apps/sites, we will request permission using Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt.</li>
            <li><strong>Android/iOS:</strong> You can often limit ad personalization via your device privacy settings (availability varies by OS and region).</li>
            <li><strong>EEA/UK/Switzerland:</strong> Where required, we (or Google) may request consent for personalized advertising.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        For more information about how Google processes data in its services, see Google’s Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can also learn more about how Google advertising works and manage ad settings here:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>7) Analytics and Crash Reports</h2>
        <p>
            We do not use separate analytics or crash reporting SDKs that we control which collect personal data.
            AdMob may provide aggregated reporting related to ad delivery and performance.
            App performance data may also be available to us via standard reporting provided by Apple App Store and Google Play.
        </p>

        <h2>8) How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide core features (scanning, deck management, collection tracking, game tracking)</li>
            <li>Save your decks, collections, and settings on your device</li>
            <li>Display, measure, and provide rewarded ads (optional) used to temporarily reduce or disable ads</li>
            <li>Maintain app security, prevent fraud/abuse, and improve stability and performance</li>
            <li>Investigate and fix issues when you choose to send a bad scan report</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9) Sharing of Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>Your in-app content (decks/collections/game logs) is not shared with us</strong> unless you explicitly choose to share/export it or send a bad scan report.</p>
        <p>Information may be shared in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect and transmit certain device/app information to Google to serve and measure ads.</li>
            <li><strong>User-initiated sharing:</strong> when you export/share a file, it is sent via the method you select (email, messaging apps, cloud drives, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Bad scan reports:</strong> if you email a report to us, we receive the attached file and email metadata.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> we may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10) Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p><strong>On-device data:</strong> Your decks, collections, settings, and game logs remain on your device until you delete them in the App or uninstall the App.</p>
        <p><strong>Bad scan reports (email):</strong> If you email us a report, we retain it only as long as needed to investigate and resolve the issue, after which we delete or anonymize it when feasible.</p>
        <p><strong>Third-party SDK data (e.g., AdMob):</strong> Retention is governed by the provider’s policies.</p>
        <p><strong>How to delete your data:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete decks, collections, or game logs within the App</li>
            <li>Uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data</li>
            <li>Contact us to request deletion of a bad scan report you emailed to us</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11) Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>12) Children’s Privacy (13+)</h2>
        <p>
            The App is <strong>not directed to children under 13</strong> and is intended for users aged 13 and older.
            We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
            If you believe a child has provided personal information to us (for example via a bad scan report email), please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>13) International Users</h2>
        <p>If third-party providers process data outside your country, your information may be transferred internationally as part of using those services.</p>

        <h2>14) Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on where you live (including the EEA), you may have rights to access, delete, or object to certain processing.
            For on-device data, you can delete it directly in the App or by uninstalling.
            For bad scan reports you emailed to us, you can contact us to request deletion.
        </p>

        <h2>15) Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy at the URL above and update the effective date.</p>
